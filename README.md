# Shopping app

## Task:

Create a simple ''shopping'' React app that supports the following:
1. Swipeable views to move between categories. IMPORTANT: if one scrolls down in a view then swipes slowly they should see the transition happening, such as the current view's Y-axis stays where it was and the revealed view is at the beginning.  
2.  Selection between 'Gallery' and 'List' display. Preferences are global (same on all views)
3.  'Show Cart' button that is available from all views and opens a modal (or similar) with only the data of the selected items.

##General:
      
* Use static mock data to your liking
* Please adhere to only React and do not use other JS libraries
* Design does not have to be sophisticated, but should be elegant
* Submit your solution via a GitHub repository link.
* Feel free to ask anything that is not clear
